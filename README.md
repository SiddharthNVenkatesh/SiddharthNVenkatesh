Hi, I’m Siddharth Venkatesh. I'm a mathematics Ph.D., currently working as a post-doc, interested in transitioning into a data science career. 
I find machine learning and its applications to understanding systems fascinating, in the same way in which I've enjoyed understanding abstract mathematical 
systems during my phd. At the moment, I am learning the mathematics and programming implementations of different machine learning and artificial intelligence methodologies.

I'm also very passionate about strategy board games, and am currently working on a blog that uses machine learning and data analysis to study board games, 
both from the strategy viewpoint and the player preference viewpoint. During covid, a lot of board gaming has moved online, which has given us access to unprecedent amounts of data.

If you want to collaborate on this idea, or just generally want to discuss mathematics, machine learning or board games, get in touch. 
You can contact me at siddharth.n.venkatesh@gmail.com.
